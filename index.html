					  	<hr>
					  	<p>Hi,</p>
					  
						<p>I'm from Mumbai. Presently working as <b>Content Development Editor</b> at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt</a>. I am  Web developer, and a Tech Enthusiast.<p>
						<p>I have completed my bachelor’s degree in <i>Computer Science</i> as well as in <i>Computer Application</i>. Along with these accomplishments, I am passionate about and have worked on the microprocessors such as Raspberry Pi, Aurdino. I have worked on the respective microprocessors. I have a knack for creating a personal web server and IOT projects.</p>
						<p>I have keen interest in a range of technologies such as <i>3D printing</i>, <i>High-Performance Computing</i>, <i>Robotics</i>, <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, <i>AWS</i>, <i>CDN</i>, and much more.</p>
						<p>As a Content Development Editor (CDE) I need to be well versed with technical, project management and linguistic skills to help authors create engaging technical content allowing readers to easily learn new technologies and develop new skills. I need to conduct thorough research on the technology which the authors will be working on, to make sure that they are well equipped for the project. This will support the authors and other members efficiently to develop the content for the book. Along with this I also need to keep an eye on market trends or version updates to ensure that the content is updated for the readers. I need to develop and maintain a good rapport with authors, technical reviewers, and other stakeholders, as they will be working together with me throughout the process of book development. As a CDE, I also need to make sure that the structure and flow of the content cater to the needs of the target audience. This ensures that the most up-to-date and accurate content is delivered to the readers. </br></br>
						As a CDE, I need to be involved in the process of scheduling activities to ensure that content is received in a timely manner from the authors and this also accommodates any delays that occur in deliverables. I need to work on around ten to fifteen projects at a time, manage time and focus my attention on all my projects equally for their smooth functionality and meet deadlines as well comply with existing quality reporting standards. Needs to develop SEO friendly and engaging content to market the books/videos on websites. During this period, I try to identify risks that may come up along the way and develop the best plan to avoid them. This responsibility has helped me improve my project management skills and be in touch with technology trends all the time.</p>
						<p>As a Technical Editor (TE), I was considered to be a proxy reader of the book. I was responsible to check the accuracy of the content and structure of the book, test and validate the code present in it. I needed to ensure that it follows the instruction given by the author and can be easily replicated and verify that the content in the book communicates its goals to the reader. As a TE I was a link between production team and the reader. This, in turn, helps and motivated me to stay updated with the latest trends and technology.</br></br>
						I don't believe in giving up that's why I try to find various ways to resolve the issues that arise during the timeline of the project.</p>
						<p>In my free time, I like to listen to music, read books or play video games. I have also developed a website for <a href="https://www.newarchstudio.com/" target="_blank">New Arch Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.commanderinfra.com/" target="_blank">Commander Infra</a> who are clients for <a href="http://glamoglitz.com/" target="_blank">GlamOGlitz Inc.</a>, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<p>
						<p>My colleagues and friends have commended me for my skill of adaptability, positive thinking, and engaging responsibility.</p>
